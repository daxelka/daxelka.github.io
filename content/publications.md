* **A. Dubovskaya**, S. C. Fennell, K. Burke, J. P. Gleeson, and D. Oâ€™Kiely, "Analysis of mean-field approximation for Deffuant opinion dynamics on networks", *SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics 83, no. 2, pp. 436-459, 2023*

* [We analyze the mean-flied Deffuant model on networks with two degree classes and a fully-mixed population. We examine early-time and late-time dynamics and accurately estimate the number and positions of final opinion clusters through linear stability analysis, validated against numerical simulations.]*

* **A. Dubovskaya** and E. Benilov, "Paradoxical behaviours of swirling jets", *Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 925 (A 12), pp. A12-1-A12-26, 2021*.

*[We investigate the behavior of swirling jets ejected from a circular orifice at an angle to the horizontal with a high Froude number. We derive a set of asymptotic equations for slender jets. A number of paradoxical behaviour is derived from the solution of our asymptotic model. In the absence of viscosity, when the swirling velocity exceeds a specific threshold, the jet can defy gravity and rise until its initial kinetic energy is depleted. Even below this threshold, downward-bending jets can exhibit surprising behavior, with the streamwise velocity decreasing due to gravity. Viscosity-dominated jets can paradoxically reach greater heights and distances than inviscid jets when bending upwards.]*
