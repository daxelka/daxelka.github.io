# Welcome

I am an applied mathematician by toolkit and a physicist by mindset. My research revolves around the evolution of nonlinear systems. My current interests include dynamical processes on social networks, such as opinion dynamics and information cascades. For analytical investigations I use perturbation theory, dynamical systems and linear stability analysis. In numerical studies, I use agent-based modeling and network and branching process simulations.

Key areas of my research are opinion dynamics, complex networks, information diffusion, fluid mechanics and geomechanics.

I obtained my PhD in Applied Mathematics in 2021 in the University of Limerick, Ireland, under supervision of Prof. Andrew Fowler and Prof. Eugene Benilov. Before coming to mathematics, I worked in geomechanics where I studied the Earth's stress distribution and its impact on seismic activity by computational modeling. I also have a PhD in Geophysics, received in 2016 in the Schmidt Institute of Physics of the Earth, Russian Academy of Science, under Prof. Igor Garagash. I received my Bachelor and Master degrees at Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (State University).

<!-- I enjoy applying my mathematical skills to problems in different areas of physics, social sciences and biological sciences.  -->
