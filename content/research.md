My research revolves around nonlinear dynamical systems. I am particularly interested in dynamics on complex networks. I like studying the bifurcations in the systems and unexpected counterintuitive behavoiur.

## Diffusion Processes on Networks

The dynamics of diffusion in complex networks are widely studied to understand how entities, such as information, diseases, or behaviors, spread in an interconnected environment. Social and physical contact networks often present community structure, and tools to analyze diffusion processes on networks with communities are needed. I develop theoretical tools using multi-type branching processes to model and analyze diffusion processes, following a simple contagion mechanism, across a broad class of networks with community structure.
This framework enables the calculation of standard statistical characteristics of propagation dynamics—such as extinction probability, hazard function, and cascade size distribution—using only limited information about the network. [arXiv preprint (2024)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04456)

## Bounded Confidence Opinion Dynamics on Networks

Opinion formation models help us understand how macro-level behaviors like consensus or polarization emerge from micro-level interactions. Bounded confidence models focus on homophily, where individuals interact only if their opinions differ within a certain "confidence bound." The value of this bound determines whether the model leads to consensus, polarization, or opinion fragmentation.
I study the extension of these models where interactions occur on a network. Using linear stability analysis of the mean-field limit of the model, I obtain analytical approximations for the bifurcation diagram, which shows how the number of opinion clusters changes as the confidence bound parameter varies.

## Coupled Opinion and Disease Dynamics on Multilayer Networks

The world of opinions and the world of actions in the physical world influence each other. People have tried to understand how opinions may affect our actions, as exemplified by the COVID-19 pandemic.
In this project, we aim to explore how real-world events can influence opinion formation. We use a multilayer network model that couples disease dynamics on one layer with the dynamics of opinions on related topics, such as the necessity of epidemic intervention, on another. Our goal is to investigate the interplay between these two dynamics, with a specific focus on whether a consensus in opinions can be reached and to what extremes it may evolve.

## Paradoxical Behaviour of Swirling Liquid Jets

I examine the shape of a steady jet with a swirling component, ejected from a circular orifice at an angle to the horizontal. Assuming a large Froude number, I derive a set of asymptotic equations for a slender jet. The analysis reveals that when the swirling velocity exceeds a critical threshold, the jet can paradoxically bend against gravity and rise until its initial kinetic energy is expended. The dynamics of downward-bending swirling jets also reveal unexpected features: viscosity-dominated jets can reach greater heights and distances than their inviscid counterparts, as viscosity suppresses the formation of stagnation points, thereby stabilizing the flow.

## Recycling of Phosphorus in the Plant-Soil System

I investigate the phosphorus dynamics in a plant-soil system. I create a mathematical model of phosphorus recycling in the soil and examine the model asymptotically and numerically with a particular interest in soil phosphorus profiles. I then explore the effects of fertilisation and harvesting activities on the model, the two major ways in which humans disrupt the natural phosphorus cycle. My model shows that when a considerable part of vegetation is removed from the system by harvesting or grazing, the model loses its stability and a Hopf periodic solution bifurcates from a quasi-steady state.
