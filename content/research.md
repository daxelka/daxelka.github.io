My research revolves around nonlinear dynamical systems. I am particulary interesting in dynamics on complex networks. I like studying the biffurcations in the systems and unexpected counterintuitive behavoiur.

## Opinion Dynamics on Networks

Opinion formation models help us understand how macro-level behaviors like consensus or polarization emerge from micro-level interactions. Bounded confidence models explore the impact of homophily, trusting similar beliefs more. This is modeled by allowing interactions to occur only between individuals whose opinions differ by less than a ”confidence bound” parameter. Depending on the value of the confidence bound, the model can lead to consensus, polarization, or opinion fragmentation.

I study the extension of the model where interactions occur within a configuration-type network composed of several degree classes. Using linear stability analysis of the mean-field limit of the model, I obtained analytical approximations for the bifurcation diagram, which illustrates how the number of opinion clusters changes with variations in the confidence bound parameter. By comparing it with the bifurcation diagram obtained from numerical simulations in the agent-based model, I demonstrate that my analytical solution accurately predicts the positions and the number of expected major opinion clusters.

## Information Diffusion on Networks

Online social networks serve as media for the spread of information among their users. The structure of the social networks plays a crucial role in the dynamics. An extensive amount of work has been dedicated to studying how information spreads between individuals connected via complex networks. However, there is a lack of understanding of the impact of community structure on how information spreads.

I use a multi-type branching processes framework to model information diffusion in the presence of community structure. I study the evolution of a cascade inside and between the communities. Using multivariate probability-generating functions I derive analytical calculations of expected cascade sizes, and probabilities of extinction, where the diffusion process follows the Independent Cascade Model. I show how the introduction of community structure changes the cascade's size and lifetime distributions.

## Paradoxical Behaviour of Swirling Liquid Jets


We examines the shape of a steady jet with a swirling component, ejected from a circular orifice at an angle to the horizontal. Assuming the Froude number to be large, we derive a set of asymptotic equations for a slender jet. In the inviscid limit, the solutions of the set predict that, if the swirling velocity of the flow exceeds a certain threshold, the jet bends against gravity and rises until the initial supply of the liquid’s kinetic energy is used up. This effect is due to the fact that the contributions of the swirl and streamwise velocities to the centrifugal force are of opposite signs, with their sum to be balanced by gravity. As a result, swirl- and streamwise-dominated jets bend in opposite directions.


Downward-bending jets also exhibit counter-intuitive behaviour. If the swirling velocity is strong enough, the streamwise velocity on the jet’s axis may decrease with the distance from the orifice, despite the acceleration due to gravity. Eventually, a stagnation point emerges due to this effect, arguably destabilising the jet. Also paradoxically, viscosity-dominated jets can reach higher  and farther than their inviscid counterparts, due to the fact that viscosity suppresses formation of stagnation points.

## Recycling of Phosphorus in the Plant-Soil System
We investigate the phosphorus dynamics in a basic plant-soil system. We create a mathematical model of phosphorus recycling in the soil and examine the model asymp- totically and numerically with a particular interest in soil phosphorus profiles. We then explore the effects of fertilisation and harvesting activities on the model, the two major ways in which humans disrupt the natural phosphorus cycle. We show that when a considerable part of vegetation is removed from the system by harvesting or grazing, the model loses its stability and a Hopf periodic solution bifurcates from a quasi-steady state.
