I believe that the primary goal of university-level education is to inspire students to cultivate critical thinking skills, and develop effective problem-solving abilities. In my classes, I concentrate on developing a profound understanding and nurturing intuition. I try to show that the journey of discovery can be more rewarding than mere possession of knowledge.

In my personal experience, the best teachers I have had were trully passionate about their subjects. In my classes, I aim to convey that same passion to my students and ignite their fascination with mathematics by sharing examples from my own research when appropriate.
